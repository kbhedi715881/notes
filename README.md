- "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning." - Rick Cook

This quote highlights the ongoing challenge that programmers face in creating user-friendly and robust software, while also acknowledging the unpredictable nature of human behavior and the potential for users to find unexpected ways to interact with technology. It serves as a reminder to always consider the end-user when designing and developing software, and to be prepared for the unexpected.

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. First, determine which tasks are most important and which can be completed later. Then, break down each task into smaller, manageable steps. By organizing your code and your workflow, you will find it easier to understand and maintain your project.

Remember to take breaks and avoid multitasking, as this can lead to mistakes and decreased productivity. Use version control, like Git, to keep track of your changes and collaborate with others. And finally, always be open to learning and improving your skills. The programming world is constantly changing, so stay up-to-date with new technologies and best practices.
