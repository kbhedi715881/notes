- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil' — Donald Knuth. Focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code first; optimize only when necessary and after profiling. Remember that clarity and simplicity often lead to better performance in the long run." 

In more detail but still concise: 
"Optimize for readability and maintainability before prematurely optimizing for speed. Write modular and well-structured code that's easy to understand and modify. As Donald Knuth wisely said, overemphasis on efficiency early in development can lead to complex, hard-to-debug systems. Always measure and profile before making performance optimizations, as they might not always be where you expect them to be. Ultimately, a solid foundation laid with good design principles tends to yield better overall performance and adaptability."

"Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth

In fewer than 200 words: This quote by computer scientist Donald Knuth reminds us that focusing on optimizing code too early in the development process can lead to unnecessary complexity, harder-to-maintain code, and potentially overlook more significant design issues. It's often better to write clear, straightforward code first and optimize only when profiling identifies genuine bottlenecks, after the core functionality is correct and stable. Always consider the trade-offs between code readability, maintainability, and performance.

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can ensure that you focus on the critical aspects of the project and not get sidetracked by less significant details. Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of your priorities. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning ahead is crucial for success in programming. When starting a new project or undertaking a large task, take the time to break it down into smaller, manageable steps. Creating a detailed plan will ensure you have a clear understanding of what needs to happen and when, allowing you and your team to stay on track and avoid last-minute surprises.  
3. Stay organized: A clean and organized codebase is a joy to work with and will lead to a smoother development process. Implement version control systems, like Git, early and often to track changes and collaborate with others. Organize your code into logical, well-named files and folders, using well documented comments to explain the functionality and purpose of each section. Additionally, maintain a consistent coding style and convention to make your work more readable and maintainable.

- "Today's programming wisdom: 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.' — Leonardo da Vinci. In coding, strive to write clean, readable, and maintainable code that solves the problem at hand with the least complexity possible. Remember that what you build today may need to be understood and extended by others tomorrow or even years from now. Also, always embrace the power of abstraction, modularity, and testing to ensure your code's longevity, robustness, and adaptability." 

Another relevant adage is, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth. This reminds us not to over-engineer solutions before fully understanding the problem and requirements, and to focus on writing correct and clear code first, optimizing only when necessary based on data and performance metrics."
